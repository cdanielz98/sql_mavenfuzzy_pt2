<h2><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>The Situation</h2>
(Dated: 20.03.2015)
Cindy is close to securing Maven Fuzzy Factory's next round of funding, and she needs your help to tell a compelling story to investors. You'll need to pull the relevant data, and help your CEO craft a story about a data-driven company that has been producing rapid growth.
<br>
<br>
<h3><a href="#">&#x200B;</a>
1.Task 1:<br>
First, I'd like to show our volume growth. Can you pull overall session and order volume, trended by quarter for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it.
![T1](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/25aded98-d856-42e0-bd85-c981d51a6368)
> A steady increase in sessions and order volume by quarter for the life of the business.
<br>
<br>

Task 2:<br>
Next, let's showcase all of our efficiency improvements. I would love to show quarterly figures since we launched, for session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, and revenue per session.

![T2](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/3665d1a5-d718-41e1-ae0a-acfe1039f509)

>Improvements in all areas: session to order conversion rates, revenue per order, and revenue per session, quarterly for the life of the business.
<br>
<br>
Task 3:<br>
I'd like to show how we've grown specific channels. Could you pull a quarterly view of orders from Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search, and direct type-in?

![T3](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/57e7c82e-4b79-4fcd-b454-0392bea832b0)

>A steady increase in orders from all channels. Note: importantly, an increase in orders from direct type-ins and organic search as more people become aware of our brand.
<br>
<br>
Task 4:<br>
Next, let's show the overall session-to-order conversion rate trends for those same channels, by quarter. Please also make a note of any periods where we made major improvements or optimizations.

![T4](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/930d27f9-319d-4399-8036-741d50dbd78c)

> There has been an overall increase in conversion rate across all channels.
> We can also see a slight increase in conversion rates across all channels in the first quarter of 2013, which coincides with the launch of our second product.
<br>
<br>
Task 5:<br>
We've come a long way since the days of selling a single product. Let's pull monthly trending for revenue and margin by product, along with total revenue and margin. Note anything you notice about seasonality.

![T5](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/b9c791e9-8446-47d7-8904-4942c84f3c4e)

>Monthly, revenue and margin increases for all products, consequently there is also an increase in total revenue and margin.<br>
>Regarding seasonality, there is a distinct spike in revenue every November and December which could link to increases in sales during Black Friday and Christmas.
<br>
<br>
Task 6:<br>
Let's dive deeper into the impact of introducing new products. Please pull monthly sessions to the /products page, and show how the clickthrough rates to another page have changed over time, along with a view of how conversion from /products to placing an order has improved.

![T6](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/a90debe7-71d4-414b-b579-afdfb90c5178)

>There is a steady increase in sessions clicking through from the products page, and products to order conversion rates over the life of the business.
<br>
<br>
Task 7:<br>
We made our 4th product available as a primary product on December 05, 2014 (it was previously only a cross-sell item). Could you pull sales data since then, and show how well each product cross-sells from one another?

![T7](https://github.com/cdanielz98/maven-fuzzy-factory-sql/assets/135237144/968d5aee-e818-470e-aef3-984274d74ae4)

>Product 4 had the highest cross selling rate across all other primary products, upon further investigation this may be because it was cheaper than all other products making it an easy add-on.
<br>
<br>
Task 8:<br>
In addition to telling investors about what we've already achieved, let's show them that we still have plenty of gas in the tank. Based on all the analysis you've done, could you share some recommendations and opportunities for us going forward?
>As previously mentioned, many users added product 4 on to their orders and it was an effective cross-sell product.<br>
>It may be worth looking into adding similar products that also have lower price points and see if these are effective.<br>
<br>
>Also the 'gsearch_nonbrand' channel brings in a lot of traffic to the website, it may be worth looking into increasing the bids for this channel.
